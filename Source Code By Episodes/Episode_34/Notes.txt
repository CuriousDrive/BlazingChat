User Story :
    We will add an "Activate" Screen which will be only visible to "Admin" role.
    This role value will come from User's table with Column 'Role'
    When the user is created then this value is empty 
    This value could be updated from Activate page.
    The page will show all the users which do not have any role
    And all those users will have dropdown control with below values
    "General" & "Admin"
    Once one of these these roles are assigned then user can do normal activities

The arguement is what about storing this in JWT?
    It makes sense to use JWT because it will be faster
    Currently I am pulling the user creating the JWT 
    sending the JWT to the client 
    I need to read more about this
